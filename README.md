**Portfolio for all of my data analytics projects**

## [Project 1: Air Quality Regression Analysis with Python from scratch](https://github.com/jtanumihardja/ML-IE7300)

This project is an individual semester-long project for IE 7300 Statistical Learning for Engineering class. The project objective is to design, implement, evaluate, and validate machine learning models using Python programming. The models are based on regression. The business problem to be addressed is training the model and predicting the target variable values. The objective of this project is to perform statistical analysis on this dataset to find a regression equation to predict the fit and and conclude which regression equation is the best fit for each parameter.

## Project 2: Food Delivery Application Database in SQL  

This is a group project consisting 5 people to create a food delivery database using SQL. The purpose of this database is to maintain the data used to support online food ordering and delivery services. The database can be used by the restaurant manager (obtain and track order), delivery person (obtain delivery information), and customer (order and provide ratings). This database serves as a platform to perform contactless business, track orders and perform order analytics. 

The database containes 4 schemas and 15 entities. Triggers were used to update the user, order, and payment automatically. Column data encryption was used on password to increase security. Computed column procedure was used to calculate payment according to membership level discount automatically. The custom database was tested using 20 restaurants from 4 different US states with at least 3 menu items from each restaurants. SQL Views query were set up for common analytics such as average restaurants rating, top 3 restaurants, and restaurant menus. Vizualizations with PowerBI for those views were also set as shown below.

## Project 3: Boston Craigslist Housing Analysis in R (ongoing)

This individual semester-long project for PPUA 5262 Big Data for Cities class in R. The project objective is to process, analyze and visualize Craigslist's Housing data in Massachusets. The main focus will be in Boston area, turning the big data into products that might benefit communities. Some of the analysis involves housing access, conditions, and equity across Boston’s neighborhoods.

## Project 4: Visualization and Data Analytics in R (ongoing)

This is a group project consisting 4 people for IE6600 Computation and Visualization in R.
